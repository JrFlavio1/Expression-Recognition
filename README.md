# Expression Recognition
 
This project implements a facial expression recognition system using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify images into one of seven categories of expressions: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise.

## Dataset

The Dataset used for the project is the FER2013 in whitch can be downloaded here:

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

tensorflow

```bash
pip install tensorflow
```

keras

```bash
pip install keras
```

numpy

```bash
pip install numpy
```

pandas

```bash
pip install pandas
```

opencv-python

```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

matplotlib

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```

## Running the project

Download the dataset and change the PATH in the Dataset section to the path of the train and test directories.

## Testing

In the Viewing Resunts section change the PATH to the path of the image you want to test the model with. For a better interpretation for the model I reccomend using images that have the same properties as the FER2013 dataset. The dataset CK+ has the same characteristics as the FER2013 you can find the dataset here:
